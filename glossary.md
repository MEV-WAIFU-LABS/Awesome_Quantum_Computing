## Quantum Computing Glossary

* ** Superposition**: allows a quantum computerâ€™s memory to be in many classical states "at the
same time", each state having a certain weight or "amplitude" (which may be negative). 

* **Interference**: allows different superpositions to combine in a way that is similar to waves:
positive and negative amplitudes will cancel each other out, while amplitudes with the same
sign will add up.

* **Entanglement**: allows different parts of the quantum computer, or even different quantum
computers that are far away from each other, to be correlated in ways that are not possible
classically

**Quantum information scrambling**: when local information is thrown into a disorder throughout a quantum system.
